        <span class="byline headby">
          ... was a project to steward a building in Oakland, California for community use.
          We started with a lease in 2014, bought it with a short-term loan in 2016, and after failing to
          find a long-term lender, finally sold it in 2024 to <a style="font-weight:bold;background-color:#4D2727;" href="https://www.thecalli.org/">CALLI</a>
          for the price of the remaining debt.
          <br /><br />
          This was a site of dreams, disappointment, drama, struggle, chaos, profound joy and deep harm.
          People met, came of age, got married, and died here. Countless orgs began with a meeting here.
          Others ended here in tears. The word is now full of alumni and/or bitter survivors of the charismatic mess that was Omni.
